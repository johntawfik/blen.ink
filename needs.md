✅ Why Rendering PDFs as Images Can Be Good
100% Formatting Fidelity

No broken fonts, layouts, or diagrams.

Great for books with lots of complex formatting (like textbooks, graphic novels, or design-heavy documents).

No Need to Parse PDF Internals

You avoid the headache of handling weird fonts, broken encoding, or malformed PDFs.

No need to rely on flaky PDF text extractors (pdf.js, pdf2text, etc.).

Graphics & Custom Fonts Render Well

Embedded diagrams, handwritten notes, or special glyphs won’t get lost.

❌ But Here Are the Tradeoffs
🔍 No Text Selectability or Copying
Users can’t highlight, search, or copy text, unless you layer in OCR.

🧠 No Easy Integration with AI Features
You can’t use features like inline summarization, TTS, definitions, or smart annotations unless you:

Do OCR (e.g., Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision),

Map text back to coordinates, and

Maintain a searchable invisible layer.

📦 Performance & Storage
Larger file sizes (images per page) can hit load times and RAM usage.

Rendering a full book may lead to lag, especially on mobile.

💡 What You Can Do Instead (or In Addition)
Option 1: Hybrid Approach
Render images, but also run OCR in the background to:

Provide search

Enable text selection

Support AI features (summarization, TTS, etc.)

Libraries/Tools:

🧠 Tesseract.js (OCR in browser)

🧠 Google Cloud Vision (accurate + bounding boxes)

🧠 pdf2json + pdf-lib if you want both raw text and layout metadata

Option 2: Auto-convert to HTML/Text (when possible)
If the user uploads a clean, reflowable PDF:

Use pdf.js or mupdf to extract text.

Render in a beautiful reader view (like Readwise Reader or Pocket).

Fall back to image mode only when needed.

👨‍💻 TL;DR Recommendation
If you're optimizing for fidelity + simplicity now (especially with books that break easily), continue using images.

But long-term, add an invisible OCR layer so you can unlock:

Text selection

Annotations

Summaries

Search

TTS
